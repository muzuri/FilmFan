# FILM FAN

Film Fan is a new startup based in Kigali. Their vision is to become the single place for discovering and booking movies in Rwanda. Their 
strategy is to first introduce a mobile app that allows their customers to discover movies they may be interested in. Once they build a 
customer base, they will introduce the functionality to book movies in the cinema. Theyâ€™ve asked you to help them build their mobile app.
